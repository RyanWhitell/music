    "### Rhythm\n",
    "A large part of playing the bass revolves around rhythm. The rhythmic foundation refers to the consistent pulse of the music. A skilled bassist supports the group by providing a good-feeling, steady pulse. Most music that is well received has a steady rhythm, or beat, to it."

    "### Bass and Lead\n",
    "As far as the note side of music goes, chords, and the notes they contain (chord tones), are the primary thing bassists need to understand and study. A bassists main role is to support the lead (guitar, piano, etc...) by playing harmonies under the chords. Mostly this means playing the root note of the chords in the chord progression, emphasizing individual notes of the chord."

    "Traditionally, bass players don’t play the main melodies of songs. As bass players, we support and interact with the main melody of a song by providing rhythm and harmony underneath it. When we hear several notes played at the same time, we hear them all relative to the lowest sounding pitch — the bass note.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common type of melody you'll find bassists playing is the **riff**. A riff is a repeated melody often played at the same time as other instruments. Another type of melody is an instrumental **solo**."

    "\n",
    "**Chromatic approach notes** are ones that come from one semitone above or below a destination note. Many times when two main notes are separated by one note you can use the note in-between to connect them. In this instance we'd call the chromatic note a **passing tone**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chromatic approach note is usually a very weak, unstable note to play. If you emphasize it in the wrong place rhythmically, you can really upset things. Most often these chromatic notes fall in weak places like in between the beats, or on beats 2 & 4. Rarely do they fall on beats 1 & 3 where your ear expects to hear strong supportive notes like the root and fifth instead. "
